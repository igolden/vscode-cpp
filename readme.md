vscode-cpp
---

VScode doesn't come with C++ build support out of the box. This is a small hello world app that makes it easy to compile and build without adding gulp to your project.

**Clone the Repo**

```
git clone git@github.com:igolden/vscode-cpp
```

**Open the folder in VSCode**

You'll have these commands available to you:

```
CMD+SHIFT+B    ==>     Compile your code, ouput will throw errors if any.
CMD+SHIFT+R    ==>     Runs './a.out' which runs your program
```
